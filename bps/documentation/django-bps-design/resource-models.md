Given the updated understanding of your system with `PlanningFact` as the core for year/version-dependent data, and `RateCardTemplate` and `PositionTemplate` as master data, the **`Resource` model (the one intended to represent *individual people* like actual employees or contractors)** becomes **less immediately necessary for core *budgeting and planning***, but it could still be very useful or even necessary for other aspects of resource management.

Let's break it down:

**Why it's less necessary for *budgeting and planning* (in the context of `PlanningFact`):**

* **Rates are generic:** `RateCardTemplate` defines a rate for a `skill/level/category/country` combination. The specific dollar value for this rate in a given year/version is stored in `PlanningFact`. You don't need to link to an *individual person* to get this rate.
* **Positions are generic:** `PositionTemplate` defines a role (`code/skill/level/department`). The budgeted FTE for this position in a given year/version is also in `PlanningFact`. You're budgeting for a *role*, not a specific person, at this stage.
* **"Is open" is a `KeyFigure`:** The status of a position (`is_open`) or its `intended_resource_category` can be `KeyFigure`s in `PlanningFact` linked to the `PositionTemplate`. This means you can budget for whether a *position* is open or filled, and by what type of resource, without knowing *who* fills it.

**When a `Resource` model (representing actual individuals) *would still be necessary or highly beneficial*:**

1.  **Actual Staffing and Assignments:** If you need to track *who* is actually filling a specific `PositionTemplate` or working on a particular project. This moves beyond just budgeting for FTEs to actual "people management."
    * Example: "John Doe (Employee) is filling `DEV-001` from 2025-07-01." or "Jane Smith (Contractor) is working on Project X."
    * This would typically involve linking `PositionTemplate` (if filled) to a `Resource`, or having a `ProjectAssignment` model that links `Resource` to `Project`.

2.  **Individual Skill Tracking & Profiles:** If you need to manage granular skills, certifications, performance reviews, or other HR-specific data for *each individual employee or contractor*.
    * `RateCardTemplate` and `PositionTemplate` deal with *generic* skill/level combinations. An individual `Resource` can have multiple skills and specific proficiency levels.

3.  **Actual Cost Tracking (vs. Budgeted):** Your `PlanningFact` holds *budgeted* values. If you need to track *actual* expenses incurred by specific individuals (e.g., actual hours worked by John Doe, actual travel expenses of Jane Smith), you'd need a `Resource` model linked to expense/time-tracking systems.

4.  **Utilization Tracking:** If you want to see how much time an *actual person* spends on various projects or tasks across your organization.

5.  **People-Centric Reporting:** "Show me all active employees and contractors," "What is the average tenure of our Senior Java Developers?"

6.  **HR/Vendor Management Integration:** The `Employee` and `Contractor` (and `Vendor`) models you sketched out earlier would be where you store specific HR or vendor management details. The `Resource` model could then be a lightweight abstraction over these, allowing uniform access to "a person."

**Recommendation:**

For your *current focus on year-dependent budgeting and planning using `PlanningFact`*, the `Resource` model (and the underlying `Employee`/`Contractor` models) is **not strictly necessary to define rates or position budgets**. Your `RateCardTemplate` and `PositionTemplate` provide the necessary master data for the `PlanningFact` entries.

However, if your system's scope will eventually extend to:
* Tracking **actual people** filling those positions.
* Managing **individual assignments** to projects.
* Reporting on **individual utilization or actual costs**.
* Maintaining **detailed individual profiles** (beyond what's in `RateCardTemplate`).

Then, a `Resource` model (perhaps a lean one that links to more detailed `Employee` or `Contractor` models) will become **highly beneficial and likely necessary**.

**In summary:**

* **For budget *planning* (what you've described):** `RateCardTemplate` and `PositionTemplate` are sufficient master data with `PlanningFact` storing the values.
* **For budget *execution*, *actuals*, and *people management*:** A `Resource` model becomes critical.

You can start without it for the core planning system and introduce it later as your needs evolve, creating a natural progression from "planning for roles" to "managing people in roles."
