Business Planning System (BPS)

Target: IT Company (e.g., Captive IT Services Company)

⸻

1. System Overview

BPS supports end-to-end business planning, budgeting, forecasting, and reporting within an IT service organization. It enables structured planning workflows across hierarchical organizational units and dynamic planning configurations with versioned data and comprehensive auditing.

⸻

2. Functional Overview

Core Functionalities
	•	Hierarchical Planning
	•	Dynamic Planning Dimensions
	•	Versioning & Scenario Management
	•	Workflow Management
	•	Data Input & Distribution
	•	Formula-based Calculation
	•	Planning Sequences (like SAP BW-BPS)
	•	Reporting & Analytics

Workflow
	•	Draft → Completed → Frozen:
OrgUnit leads draft, submit planning; Admin freezes.
	•	Planning Versions & Scenarios:
Allows scenario simulations (Best/Worst Case).

Users and Roles

Role	Description
Planning Admin	Configure layouts, dimensions, manage workflows, freeze plans
OrgUnit Head	Draft & submit plans
Finance / Analysts	View, analyze, run reports
IT Admin	Maintain system, users, security

3. Technical Architecture

High-level Architecture

[Web Browser] (Vue.js, Bootstrap5, CrispyForms)
      │
[Django Application] (Dynamic Forms, DAL autocomplete)
      │
[PostgreSQL DB] (Planning Cube, JSONB, EAV)

Django Structure

planning/
├── models.py (core data models)
├── admin.py (admin interface)
├── forms.py (dynamic fact forms, session workflow)
├── views.py (business logic, planning sessions, period grouping)
├── templates/ (user interface)
│   └── planning/
│       └── *.html (crispy, bootstrap, Vue)
├── static/ (CSS/JS/Vue components)
├── migrations/
├── management/ (planning functions, sequences)


⸻

4. Data Model

Core Concepts
	•	InfoObject (Abstract)
	•	Common base for dimension tables (Year, Version, OrgUnit, CostCenter, InternalOrder).
	•	PlanningLayout & PlanningLayoutYear
	•	Defines dimensions per planning year, allowing flexible yearly dimension changes.
	•	Period & PeriodGrouping
	•	Flexible monthly, quarterly, semiannual planning buckets.
	•	PlanningSession
	•	Tracks OrgUnit’s planning state (Draft, Completed, Frozen).
	•	PlanningFact & FactField (EAV approach)
	•	Flexible fact model with configurable fields, dynamic dimension structures.
	•	UserMaster
	•	Custom user hierarchy (OrgUnit, CostCenter assignment).

Dimension Hierarchy Example

OrgUnit
├── Dept A
│   ├── Team A1 (CostCenter 1001)
│   └── Team A2 (CostCenter 1002)
└── Dept B
    └── Team B1 (CostCenter 2001)


⸻

5. User Interface (UI)
	•	Front-end Framework: Bootstrap5, Crispy Forms
	•	Dynamic Forms: Database-driven forms (FactField)
	•	Autocomplete: DAL (django-autocomplete-light)
	•	Interactivity: Vue.js for enhanced UX

Key UI Elements
	•	Planning Session Screen:
	•	Select period groupings (Monthly, Quarterly, Semiannual)
	•	Enter planning data in dynamic, configurable grid forms.
	•	Workflow Screen:
	•	View/edit planning drafts
	•	Approve (completed), Freeze (finalize)

⸻

6. Planning Logic & Calculation
	•	Formula & Variables:
	•	Global variables (PlanningVariable)
	•	Formula-based calculations (Formula, SubFormula, Constant)
	•	Planning Sequences:
	•	Execute sequences of planning functions (copy, distribute, calculate).
	•	Data Distribution Logic:
	•	Distribution by key, reference, or custom-defined strategies.
	•	Data Auditing & Journaling:
	•	Track each DataRequest operation.

⸻

7. Limitations & Improvement Suggestions

Limitations Identified
	1.	Performance Risks (JSON/EAV):
	•	Dynamic fields using JSON/EAV may lead to query performance degradation at scale.
	2.	Complexity in UI Customization:
	•	Fully dynamic forms might become overly complex to manage in the UI without advanced frontend handling.
	3.	Lack of built-in Analytics/Reporting:
	•	Current model doesn’t have strong built-in analytics or visualization capabilities.
	4.	Limited built-in Workflow Engine:
	•	Workflow states are basic (Draft → Completed → Frozen). Complex workflows need additional enhancements.
	5.	Period grouping limitations:
	•	Limited to monthly, quarterly, semiannual; custom period groupings (e.g., weeks, custom fiscal periods) require extra logic.

⸻

8. Recommendations for Enhancement

Data Model Improvements
	•	Star-Schema Approach:
	•	Consider nightly ETL jobs from EAV to star-schema DataMart to improve reporting performance.
	•	Enhanced Dimension Hierarchy:
	•	Introduce a general tree-model (django-mptt) to improve hierarchy traversal performance and ease.
	•	Planning Cube Integration (e.g., Apache Druid, ClickHouse):
	•	To support real-time analytics at scale.

UI & UX Enhancements
	•	Advanced Vue.js Planning Grid:
	•	Incorporate an advanced grid component (AG Grid, Handsontable) for better data-entry experience.
	•	Interactive Dashboards:
	•	Use libraries like Chart.js, Plotly, or Tableau Integration for real-time insights.
	•	Workflow Engine Integration:
	•	Adopt a more powerful workflow engine (e.g., Django-River, django-fsm) to handle complex approval chains.

Analytical & Reporting Improvements
	•	Built-in BI Layer:
	•	Integrate reporting tools like Superset, PowerBI Embedded, or Metabase.
	•	Forecasting & Scenario Analysis:
	•	Provide built-in scenario comparison (Plan vs Actual, scenario analysis).

Technical Improvements
	•	Caching & Performance Optimization:
	•	Implement Redis caching for frequent reads.
	•	Background Processing (Celery):
	•	Use Celery for asynchronous formula calculations, sequences, heavy operations.
	•	Enhanced Security & Audit Logging:
	•	Incorporate detailed audit logs (django-auditlog) for compliance and tracking changes.

⸻

9. Security & Compliance Considerations
	•	Role-based Access Control (RBAC): clearly defined user permissions.
	•	Audit Logs: for every critical action, including planning approvals, changes.
	•	Compliance: ensure financial data compliance (e.g., SOX, GDPR).

⸻

10. Next Steps & Implementation Plan
	1.	POC/Prototype Development:
	•	Implement dimension hierarchy optimization (django-mptt).
	•	Proof-of-concept for star-schema planning cube.
	2.	Performance Benchmarking:
	•	Stress-test EAV/JSON data structures.
	•	Compare with star-schema/DataMart ETL approach.
	3.	Enhance Workflow & UI/UX:
	•	Add advanced grid entry and scenario analysis UI.
	4.	Integration & Analytics:
	•	Integrate BI tools for advanced reporting capabilities.
	5.	Rollout Strategy:
	•	Gradual rollout: initial small OrgUnit, expand iteratively.

⸻

11. Conclusion

The proposed design provides robust flexibility and meets foundational needs but requires careful consideration around performance, complexity, and analytics. Enhancements recommended herein (especially data performance optimizations, advanced workflow handling, and richer analytical capabilities) will position the BPS as a complete, scalable solution.
