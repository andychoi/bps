Here’s a refined, grouped, and supplemented list of IT Service Cost Planning Requirements tailored specifically for a captive IT company, following best practices from industry research:

⸻

1. Resource Capacity Planning
	•	Employee Resources
	•	Position tracking by skill group and seniority level:
        •	Existing positions (filled and open)
        •	New positions (temporary position IDs)
	•	Availability measured in Man-Months (FTE equivalent)
	•	Skill groups clearly defined and categorized:
        •	Managerial and Analysis:
            •	Manager, Project Manager
            •	Business Analyst / Business Systems Analyst (BA/BSA)
        •	Technical Expertise:
            •	Solution/Enterprise Architect
            •	Developer / Software Engineer
            •	QA/Test Engineer
            •	System Administrator (SysAdmin) / DevOps Engineer
        •	Supplemental recommended roles: (Optional, based on industry practices)
            •	Security Specialist
            •	Data Engineer / Analyst
            •	Support Engineer (Application or Infrastructure)
    •	External Resources (Outsourcing)
        •	Sourcing strategy (Contractor vs. MSP)
        •	Efficiency factor benchmarks per sourcing country
        •	Hourly rates per country and skill group
        •	Planned insourcing-to-outsourcing ratio by skill group

⸻

2. Demand Planning per System/Service
	•	Forecasted demand (Man-Months) for each system/service by:
        •	Skill group (e.g., Architect, Developer, QA, BA/BSA, SysAdmin)
        •	Internal resources (employees) and external resources (contractors/MSPs)
	•	Demand categorized clearly into:
        •	Business-As-Usual (BAU) support (Run)
        •	System Enhancements (Change)
        •	New development/Innovation (Grow)

⸻

3. Cost Allocation Framework
	•	Employee and External Resource Cost Allocation
        •	Allocation of employee and outsourced resources’ cost per system/service.
        •	Costs based on actual Man-Month allocation.
	•	Administrative Cost Allocation
    	•	Admin overhead costs (HR, Finance, Procurement, Corporate Planning) aggregated and allocated to system/service based proportionally on Man-Month distribution.
    	•	Admin costs allocation aligned clearly with industry-standard cost accounting methods.
	•	Organizational Unit Cost Allocation
        •	Org-unit management costs allocated top-down through organizational hierarchy.
        •	Costs attributed clearly at system/service level, linked to the owning org-unit.
	•	Shared Services Cost Allocation
        •	Shared services clearly identified.
        •	Defined cost allocation methods for shared services to relevant Customer Business Units (CBU).

⸻

4. Software and Licensing Cost Planning
	•	Clearly defined cost drivers per system/service, such as:
        •	User license counts
        •	Server or compute resource utilization (on-premises/cloud-based)
        •	Storage and infrastructure usage
        •	Maintenance and support agreements (annual contracts, SLAs)
	•	Linking software licenses directly to specific services/systems for transparency.

⸻

5. Internal Order and Financial Tracking
	•	Utilization of Internal Orders to plan and track outsourcing expenditures.
	•	Internal Orders may support multiple systems/services, with traceability mechanisms clearly defined.

⸻

6. Ownership and Organizational Alignment
	•	Defined ownership:
	•	Systems/services clearly assigned to specific Org-Units responsible for oversight.
	•	Systems explicitly assigned to CBUs for business alignment.
	•	Reporting structure:
	•	Transparent view of planning, allocation, and ownership for auditability and traceability.

⸻

7. Reporting, Analysis, and Optimization
	•	Annual and quarterly reports clearly structured for resource utilization analysis, cost monitoring, and optimization opportunities.
	•	Benchmarking practices (industry standard or historical internal benchmarks) for continuous cost optimization.

⸻

Suggested Supplemental Practices from Industry Research
	•	Adoption of IT Service Management (ITSM) and Financial Management frameworks:
	•	ITIL Service Costing and Financial Management best practices.
	•	TBM (Technology Business Management) taxonomy for improved financial transparency.
	•	COBIT framework for governance and strategic alignment.
	•	Implementation of Resource Management Tools:
	•	Resource Management or Project Portfolio Management (PPM) solutions to manage resource planning and actual effort tracking.
	•	Regular reviews (monthly/quarterly) comparing planned versus actual resource usage to inform decision-making.
	•	Inclusion of scenario-based planning (optimistic, pessimistic, realistic) for risk management.
